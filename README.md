**Mid-Year Self-Evaluation**

**Date:** June 18, 2024

**Introduction:**
As we reach the midpoint of the year, I am pleased to reflect on my progress and accomplishments since joining the Aviators team at the beginning of this year. My primary focus has been on the LAMT project, where I have worked diligently to understand the codebase and enhance my skills. Additionally, I have contributed to other initiatives such as DPS, Sonar fixes, and gained a deeper understanding of various technical aspects. This evaluation highlights my key achievements and areas of improvement.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1. **LAMT Project:**
   - I joined the LAMT project at the start of the year, and my primary objective was to understand the codebase and contribute to its development. Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of the codebase and have been able to deliver outcomes effectively.
   - My involvement in the project has allowed me to develop a strong foundation in the technology stack and has equipped me with the necessary skills to tackle complex tasks.

2. **Technical Knowledge Gained:**
   - **Mappings:** I have gained a comprehensive understanding of mappings, which has enabled me to effectively manage data transformations and ensure accurate data processing.
   - **DML Changes:** I have learned to handle DML (Data Manipulation Language) changes, which has enhanced my ability to manage and modify data structures.
   - **Groovies:** I have gained proficiency in Groovies, which has allowed me to streamline data processing and improve overall system efficiency.
   - **Utest:** I have developed a strong understanding of Utest, which has enabled me to effectively test and validate system functionality.

3. **Other Initiatives:**
   - **DPS (Data Processing System):** I have contributed to the DPS project, which has helped me refine my skills in data processing and analysis.
   - **Sonar Fixes:** I have worked on resolving Sonar issues, which has enhanced my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail.
   - **SB Card:** I have been involved in the development of the SB Card, which has given me hands-on experience with card processing and payment systems.
   - **Instant Issuance Pilot Rollout:** I have contributed to the pilot rollout of instant issuance, which has allowed me to gain experience with real-time payment processing and system integration.
   - **Paze Wallet:** I have been involved in the development of the Paze wallet, which aims to simplify ecommerce transactions by eliminating the need for consumers to input card numbers manually. This wallet will be available to consumers through participating financial institutions, ensuring a seamless checkout experience.

4. **Community Involvement:**
   - **Volunteering Events:** I have participated in various volunteering events, which have given me the opportunity to interact with the community and give back to society. These events have allowed me to develop my communication and interpersonal skills while making a positive impact.
   - **Interacting with Unprivileged Children:** I have had the chance to interact with unprivileged children and guide them, which has been a rewarding experience. This has helped me develop my patience and empathy while making a positive difference in their lives.

5. **Recognition and Feedback:**
   - **Ecards:** I have received various ecards from my colleagues and superiors for my efforts in weekend support and other initiatives. This recognition has been a significant motivator for me to continue delivering high-quality results.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Communication:** While I have made significant progress in understanding the codebase, I recognize that there is room for improvement in terms of communication. I aim to enhance my communication skills by actively participating in team discussions and ensuring that my contributions are clearly understood.
- **Task Prioritization:** As the project progresses, I need to prioritize tasks more effectively to ensure timely completion of tasks and minimize delays.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, I am satisfied with my progress so far and believe that my contributions to the LAMT project and other initiatives have been valuable. I am confident in handling mappings, DML changes, Groovies, and Utest, and I am committed to continuing my growth and development by focusing on areas for improvement and maintaining a high level of performance.
